SlicerAutoscoperM (SAM) is a free, open source and multi-platform [3D Slicer](https://slicer.org) extension being developed for image-based 3D motion tracking of skeletal structures.

SAM is a single software package based on [Autoscoper](https://github.com/BrownBiomechanics/autoscoper) that enables the 3D tracking of structures within multiple imaging modalities including single, bi-, and multi-plane videoradiography, sequential CT volume images, 4DCT image volumes sets, and MRI volume sets. SAM will be built by updating and refining Autoscoper which is a bi-plane video radiography image registration software developed at Brown University, and then integrating it into the 3DSlicer ecosystem.

## Acknowledgments

SAM development is a collaboration between Kitware, Brown University and Rhode Island Hospital, Cleveland Clinic, Mayo Clinic and Queens University that is funded in part by the National Institute of Health.

These institutions will be performing extensive user and accuracy evaluation with SAM and comparing its performance to each of the institutions in-house algorithms.

## Call for collaboration

We are actively soliciting investigators from across the world who perform skeletal motion tracking and are willing to join the effort to develop and assess SAM. If you are interested in joining, please reach out to Trey Crisco, PhD at joseph_crisco@brown.edu.
