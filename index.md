SlicerAutoscoperM (SAM) is a free, open source and multi-platform [3D Slicer](https://slicer.org) extension being developed for image-based 3D motion tracking of skeletal structures.

SAM is a single software package based on [Autoscoper](https://github.com/BrownBiomechanics/autoscoper) that enables the 3D tracking of structures within multiple imaging modalities including single, bi-, and multi-plane videoradiography, sequential CT volume images, 4DCT image volumes sets, and MRI volume sets. SAM will be built by updating and refining Autoscoper which is a bi-plane video radiography image registration software developed at Brown University, and then integrating it into the 3DSlicer ecosystem.

**Note:** SAM is available for Windows and Linux operating systems, with MacOS support currently in development.
