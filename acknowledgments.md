SAM development is a collaboration between Kitware, Brown University and Brown Univwersity Health, Cleveland Clinic, Mayo Clinic and Queens University that is funded in part by the National Institute of Health.

These institutions have performed extensive user and accuracy evaluation with Autoscoper and compared its performance to each of the institutions in-house algorithms (in review).

The SlicerAutoscoperM developers gratefully acknowledge funding for this project provided by NIH NIAMS R01AR078924 (Multi-modal Tracking of In Vivo Skeletal Structures and Implants).
