SAM development is a collaboration between Kitware, Brown University and Brown University Health, Cleveland Clinic, Mayo Clinic and Queens University that is funded in part by the National Institute of Health.

These institutions have performed extensive user and accuracy evaluation with Autoscoper and compared its performance to each of the institutions in-house algorithms, with the results published:
