Image-based object tracking performed with biplane videoradiography (BVR) is the state-of-the-art for accurate quantification of in vivo skeletal kinematics. BVR involves the frame-by-frame registration of three- dimensional (3D) rigid body volumes (e.g. bones and implants) to videoradiographs. 

The processes currently used to prepare image datasets, compute kinematics, and visualize output can involve multiple proprietary software programs and/or custom-written code. Method variability and in-house developments inhibit collaboration, limit transparency, reproducibility, and ultimately impede clinical translation. 

We have developed an extensible, open-source, software program for image-based skeletal and implant motion tracking with NIH support. SlicerAutoscoperM, referred to as “SAM”, provides researchers with a structured preprocessing workflow, full access to an ever-growing index of community-driven tools and powerful GPU enabled software to optimize registration and compute six degree-of-freedom rigid body kinematics from BVR datasets.

Researchers at all levels who use imaging systems to study arthrokinematics of skeletal structures and implants are our targeted audience. Attendees are encouraged to bring data from their labs for an interactive discussion with the workshop instructors and other attendees. Using provided sample data or their own
datasets and SAM in the 3D Slicer environment, attendees will preprocess data into suitable input for 3D optimized tracking in BVR. 

A demo of ongoing tracking within 4DCT datasets will also be presented. Users will also acquire foundational knowledge of the 3D Slicer platform, and how to retrieve existing software tools through the Extension index. The hands-on and guided tutorials will encourage discussion on use and solicit recommendations from users for improvements and future options.
